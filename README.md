### Info

I'm currently working on an iOS app called Memeinator. It's nearing release, at which point I will make it open source and host it on GitHub!

I mainly work in Swift, but I also know JavaScript and many other languages. I learn quickly and I'm always ready to try something new!

I'd love to learn Rust and Golang in the future, and improve my backend skills.

I'm always willing to work on group projects! Never hesitate to reach out.
